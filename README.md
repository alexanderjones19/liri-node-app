# Liri Node App

The Liri Node App is a Node CLI application that takes user input and references various APIs depending on what command the user gave.

The APIs being referenced are:

* BandsInTown API
* Node Spotify API
* OMDB Movie API

The user will type commands relating to whichever API they wish to query, then give a search parameter. The user will then receive a response back, all in the command-line.

The commands for Liri are as follows:

* concert-this
* spotify-this-song
* movie-this

The application can handle erroneous input and even has some default responses in the case of no result being returned by the API.

Here is a link to a demo of the workflow of the app:
